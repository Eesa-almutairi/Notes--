      <h3> What is a Nanodegree</h3> <img src="https://apps.timwhitlock.info/emoji/tables/unicode#emoji-modal". alt="question mark emoji">
      <p>
        <em> Nanodegree</em> is a path and this path starts with nothing! (i.e you start your journey building an HTML File<br>
        with blanck page).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>As a progress of this journey, you are going to gain three <span style="color:red"><b>important</b> </span> things:</b><br>
        1- New skills. <br>
        2- New knowledge.<br>
        3- New ways of thinking.
      </p>

      <h3> How to think like a programmer? </h3>
      <ul>
        <b> there are several ways of thinking:</b><br>
        <li> <em>Procedural thinking:</em> </li>
        this tpye of thinking means to creat clear instructions for computer to follow.<br>
        <li><em> Abstract thinking :</em> </li>
        it involves finding similarities among different things.The purpose of this one is <br>
        to avoid repetition of work.<br>
        <li> <em>Systemmatic thinking:</em> </li>
        It means to break big problems into small pieces to make typing code pretty easy.<br>
        <li><em>Theoritical empathy:</em></li>
        It involves understanding how the computer thinks, (i.e. imagination of how the code you are tyoing<br>
        will look like after running the program)<br>
        <li> <em>Debugging:</em></li>
        Is a Systemmatic process to identify the causes of failure for HTML file that doesn't<br>
        work.<br>
        <b>(bug means mistake, debugging is the process of finding mistakes).</b>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3> Here is a Systemmatic process to fix a problem:</h3>
      <p>
        1- collect evidence. ( asking yourself: What is made this program fail?).<br>
        2- Generate theories. (asking yourself: what may have caused this problem?).<br>
        3- Test those theories.( asking yourself: if my theories are correct, how could I find out?).<br>
        4- Fix the problem.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3> The World Wide Web (WWW):</h3>
      <p>
        <b> What is the World Wide Web?</b><br>
        it is simply collection of HTML documents.<br>
        While <em>HTML</em> stands for <b>H</b>yper <b>T</b>exts <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3> How user,computer,browser,internet,HTTP and server work together?</h3>
      <p>
        First, the <b>user</b> use the <b>computer</b> to open a web page called ( Google for example) using <br>
        the <b>browsers</b> (e.g. firefox,internt explorer,chrome etc ). second the browser will communicate with google <br>
        <b>server</b> to open the HTML document that belongs to Google using <b>HTTP.</b> Finally, the <b>server</b><br>
        will respond to the user request by displaying the document which looks like <a href="http://www.google.com">this</a>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3> Definitions of World Wide Web terms </h3>
      <p>
        <b>User:</b>
        is a person who is using the computer.He is the main part of WWW.<br>
        <b>Computer:</b>
        is the electronic device that runs the browser.<br>
        <b>browser</b>:
        is an application that communicat and requsts HTML documents<br>
        from the server.<br>
        <b>Internet:</b>
        is like a bridge between the browser and server to transfer documents.It is consider<br>
        as the world's larges computer network.<br>
        <b>Server:</b>
        is a computer, but instead of hosting and displaying documents, it is only hostign files and<br>
        documents.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>HTML Markup:</h3>
      <p>
        It is used to demonstrate how the texts in web page looks like.<br>
        <b>*</b> HTML Markup is made of things called tags.<br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3> Block Vs Inline</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Inline:</b>
        An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up<br>
        as much width as necessary.
        Examples: {a}anchor,{span} ,{br}break ,{img}image<br>
        <b>Block:</b>
        A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available<br>
        .Examples: {div} ,{P}paragraph,{address},{main}<br>
      </p>
    </div>
